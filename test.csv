VAD Question,Approach
"How to reduce construction site false alerts?","Deploy a material-aware activity recognition system combining 3D CNNs for spatial-temporal feature extraction and YOLOv7 for real-time PPE detection. Fuse LiDAR point clouds with RGB video to distinguish construction materials (e.g., rebar vs. debris). Implement contrastive learning to differentiate normal tool usage from anomalies, with federated learning (FedPCL) enabling multi-site model updates while preserving privacy via differential privacy mechanisms."
"Can Flan-T5 describe anomalies?","Integrate VQA-style explanation frameworks using vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP for visual grounding. Train Flan-T5 on anomaly caption datasets (e.g., UCF-Crime) with cross-modal attention layers aligning text prompts to spatio-temporal video features. Deploy open-set recognition to flag novel anomalies, with uncertainty quantification via Monte Carlo dropout for reliable explanations."
"How to deploy in multi-mall systems?","Implement federated prototype learning where each mall trains local prototypes for normal activities (e.g., shopping, queuing). Share encrypted prototype embeddings via secure aggregation, with differential privacy noise (ε=2.0) added to prevent membership inference attacks. Use knowledge graphs to align cross-mall traffic patterns while preserving locality-specific norms."
"How to detect rare shoplifting tactics?","Train an open-set recognizer using ProtoPNet architecture. Reject unknown tactics via Mahalanobis distance thresholds in a hyperspherical feature space. Augment training with Schrödinger bridge diffusion to synthesize rare scenarios (e.g., shelf-stuffing) while enforcing separation from normal shopper embeddings."
"How to use Yelp reviews for anomaly context?","Extract business-hour constraints and sentiment keywords from Yelp via BERT. Align text embeddings with video features using cross-modal transformers. For example, flag 'crowded restaurant' anomalies during closed hours by fusing NLP-derived schedules with vision-based occupancy analytics via bilinear pooling."
"How to adapt virtual trespassing detection?","Render synthetic trespassing scenarios using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) with controllable lighting/weather parameters. Train a lighting-invariant ViT via adversarial domain adaptation, using Fourier-based frequency masking to decouple illumination effects from human pose features. Deploy on edge devices with TensorRT optimizations."
"How to detect anomalies across smart cities?","Build cross-city knowledge graphs encoding traffic flow norms, pedestrian density patterns, and event schedules. Use federated graph neural networks to detect deviations (e.g., sudden jaywalking spikes) while preserving city-specific privacy. Apply causal transformers to eliminate temporal lag in multi-city alert systems."
"How to eliminate temporal scoring lag?","Design causal transformers with masked self-attention to prevent future frame leakage. Train with counterfactual objectives: 'What if this vehicle suddenly braked?' using physics-informed reward models. Achieve real-time scoring via sliding window inference with hybrid CPU/GPU pipelines."
"How to resolve ambiguous crowd gatherings?","Deploy multi-label prompting with CLIP-guided classifiers for scene disambiguation (e.g., 'protest' vs. 'festival'). Fuse with density-aware clustering using DBSCAN on optical flow magnitude maps. Reject outliers via hypersphere prototypes trained on normal crowd embeddings from the MSAD dataset."
"How to detect CNC machine wear?","Model tool vibration spectra using graph attention networks with nodes representing frequency bands (0-10kHz). Detect anomalies via spectral kurtosis deviations from learned prototypes. Deploy federated edge learning across factories, encrypting spectral features via homomorphic hashing."
"How to detect anomalies in airport baggage handling systems?","Track luggage with ByteTrack and model conveyor dynamics via STAE (Spatio-Temporal Autoencoders). Flag jams using Mahalanobis distance thresholds on latent space reconstructions. Fuse RFID data via cross-modal attention, with federated updates across terminals preserving operational privacy."
"Can multimodal data improve security anomaly detection?","Fuse video, audio (gunshot detection), and LiDAR via cross-modal transformers. Train on MIL-CXR dataset with RTFM for weak supervision. Deploy open-set rejection using Vision Transformer (ViT) embeddings, with prototypes for known threat types (e.g., weapons)."
"How to identify abnormal events during sports tournaments?","Train event-specific action recognition models on annotated sports datasets like FineGym or Sports-1M. Use spatio-temporal transformers for team/player trajectory prediction and rule violation detection. Integrate referee pose estimation as auxiliary supervision for detecting biased or abnormal decisions."
